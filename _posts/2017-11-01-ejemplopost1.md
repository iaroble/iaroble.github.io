YAGS - Yet Another Graph System is a GAP package for dealing with graphs, in the sense of Graph Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs of functions). Hence our graphs are ordered pairs 

YAGS is a GAP package and hence its code is interpreted and not compiled (although some compilation possibilities exist in GAP). Therefore, from the very beginning, it was clear that speed was not our main goal. Instead, we wanted a very functional, full-featured system; a system adequate for rapid prototyping of algorithms; and a quick, easy-to-use, way for testing the rapidly changing working conjectures that are typical of the research process.

YAGS was designed to be useful for research in Graph Theory and clique graphs, it offers an ample set of functions (Appendix B); a graph-drawing subsystem (Draw (B.4-15)); many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism (Chapter 5); an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working with several different graph categories (Chapter 4); and a generic backtracking subsystem useful to solve many combinatorial problems easily (Chapter 6).
